# 60 Days of Coding
***
I was recently inspired by [@jendewalt]'s(https://github.com/jendewalt/jennifer_dewalt) 180 day exercise of coding 180 Web pages over the course of 180 days. As a result, I have committed to coding for 60 days in succession to help improve my coding abilities.

I plan to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

If you find anything in this repository that you would like to use, please feel free to use it. All code within this project is free to use for personal and commerical projects. You may edit or change it as you desire. All I ask is a simple mention, either in the project or in code comments.

Thanks and enjoy!
